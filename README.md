========

Run the rat_race.py file to play the game

Use WASD for player 1 (J) and IJKL for player 2 (P). However, you can change the controls and representative letter for player 1 and 2.

"#" is wall. You cannot go through it. Following the "." to eat "@" and collect points, whoever got the most points when all "@" are eaten win.
Again, you can change "#", ".", and "@" to whatever you like in the a2.py file.
